Use pprof for profiling your go code

import _ "net/http/pprof"

and install a handler := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)


You can also find if your porgram has a profiling endpoint by

lsof -Pp $(pidof your-program) | grep less
-P => Dont name ports as services (dump raw numbers)
-p => pid we are interested in

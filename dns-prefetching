Safari, from version 5.0.1 onwards, employs a technique known as DNS
prefetching. This is designed to ensure that webpages load faster. On occasion
it can, unfortunately, have the opposite effect meaning that webpages can take
a long time to load. Or simply not load at all.

tl;dr

defaults write com.apple.safari WebKitDNSPrefetchingEnabled -boolean false

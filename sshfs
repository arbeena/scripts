The swiss army knife :-

sshfs -o Ciphers=arcfour -o Compression=no server://path /local_path

Ciphers=archfour	:=> Not the safest of ciphers, but who cares (its quite fast)
Compression=no		:=> For once leave the CPU alone, (This considerably goes easy on the cpu)


some more options:

-o cache=yes		:= allow caching 
-o kernel_cache		:= turn on kernel caching
-o compression


Umount :

fusermount -u /local_path
